    <header>What is a ‘Novel’ Coronavirus?</header>
      <p>
        A novel coronavirus (CoV) is a new strain of coronavirus.

        The disease caused by the novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China, has been named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – ‘CO’ stands for corona, ‘VI’ for virus, and ‘D’ for disease.
        Formerly, this disease was referred to as ‘2019 novel coronavirus’ or ‘2019-nCoV.’
      </p>

      <p>
        The COVID-19 virus is a new virus linked to the same family of viruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and some types of common cold.. and       
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
          Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment.
          COVID-19 affects different people in different ways. Most infected people will develop mild to moderate illness and recover without hospitalization.
        </li>
        <li>
          The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces.
          You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within close proximity of someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth..
        </li>
      </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="What_you_should_already_know">
    <header>How does the COVID-19 virus spread?</header>

      <p>The following informations you need to know how it spreads:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The virus is transmitted through direct contact with respiratory droplets of an infected person (generated through coughing and sneezing), and touching surfaces contaminated with the virus.The COVID-19 virus may survive on surfaces for several hours, but simple disinfectants can kill it.
        </li>
        <li> The virus can also spread in poorly ventilated and/or crowded indoor settings, where people tend to spend longer periods of time. This is because aerosols remain suspended in the air or travel farther than 1 metre (long-range).</li>
        <li>
          Current evidence suggests that the virus spreads mainly between people who are in close contact with each other, typically within 1 metre (short-range). A person can be infected when aerosols or droplets containing the virus are inhaled or come directly into contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth..
        </li>
      </ul>
    
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="JavaScript_and_Java">
    <header>What are the symptoms of coronavirus?</header>
      <p>
        Symptoms can include fever or chills, cough and shortness of breath, difficulty in breathing, Fatigue, Muscle or body aches, Headache, New loss of taste or smell , sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia or breathing difficulties. More rarely, the disease can be fatal.
        *This list is not all possible symptoms. Please call your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.
        Call 911 or call ahead to your local emergency facility: Notify the operator that you are seeking care for someone who has or may have COVID-19.
      </p>

      <p>
        These symptoms are similar to the flu (influenza) or the common cold, which are a lot more common than COVID-19. This is why testing is required to confirm if someone has COVID-19. It’s important to remember that key prevention measures are the same – frequent hand washing, and respiratory hygiene (cover your cough or sneeze with a flexed elbow or tissue, then throw away the tissue into a closed bin).
        This list does not include all possible symptoms. CDC will continue to update this list as we learn more about COVID-19. Older adults and people who have severe underlying medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes seem to be at higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness.
      </p>
      <p>
        COVID-19 seems to spread more easily than flu and causes more serious illnesses in some people. It can also take longer before people show symptoms and people can be contagious for longer. More information about differences between flu and COVID-19 is available in the different sections below.

        Because some of the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, it may be hard to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone, and testing may be needed to help confirm a diagnosis.

        While more is learned every day about COVID-19 and the virus that causes it, there is still a lot that is unknown . This page compares COVID-19 and flu, given the best available information to date..

    <header>How can I avoid the risk of infection?</header>
      <p>
      You will be surprised to know that microbes can survive on inert surface anywhere from a few minutes to as long as several months. It depends on the microbes and the environment it is in.
      Razors, toothbrushes, towels, nail clippers, and handkerchiefs breed a lot of infectious bacteria. Ensure you don’t share it with anyone
      </p>
      <p>
       A clear understanding of latest events can help you make wise decisions before travelling or indulging in recreational activities. For instance, a bird flu outbreak in Asia can make you reconsider about the trip you were planning. Lead in food products? Don’t eat those products.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a similar manner, respectable personal hygiene is not only about grooming yourself, but also about following the golden rule of covering your mouth when you are coughing or sneezing. Now you would question, why should I do it if I am not sick? The reason being that the disease-causing bacteria in most infections start growing and multiplying way before the symptoms actually show up.
      </p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
    <header>Should I wear a mask?</header>
    <p>
      The use of a mask is advised to protect others even if you have no symptoms.After masks are worn, they must be used and disposed of properly to ensure their effectiveness and to avoid any increased risk of transmitting the virus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The use of a mask alone is not enough to stop infections and must be combined with frequent hand washing with soap and maintaining physical distance.
      With coughing and sneezing both common COVID-19 symptoms, there has been an unprecedented global surge in the sales of medical face masks, leading to shortages for health workers in some parts of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Analysis of over 75,000 confirmed cases in China found no evidence of airborne transmission of COVID-19. Instead the overwhelming evidence suggests that it is transmitted primarily through respiratory droplets and through contact.

      Transmission through respiratory droplets differs from airborne transmission in a number of critical ways. While both are capable of transmitting respiratory infections via droplets, it's the size of the droplets that matters..

    <header>Does COVID-19 affect children?</header>
      <p>
        COVID-19 is a new virus, and we are still learning about how it affects children and pregnant women. We know people of any age can be infected and transmit the virus. However, older people and/or those with pre-existing medical conditions seem more likely to develop severe illness. Cold, mild cough, fever, and body pain are the common symptoms of infection. We have also noted that other symptoms such as pain in the abdomen, loose motions, and vomiting are also present in children.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clinical features or symptoms affecting children and adolescents, possibly associated with COVID-19, can include but are not limited to: fever, headache, body pain, tiredness, cough, breathlessness,  poor feeding,  loss of taste or smell (in a child more than eight years old),  rash,  red or pink eyes,  swollen and/or red lips, tongue, hands, feet, gastrointestinal problems (diarrhoea, vomiting).
      </p>
      <p>
        There are no medicines or pills proven to prevent coronavirus infection in any person.

        Only recently, a few vaccines are available, which mainly protect against disease. At present, the vaccines are approved for use in adults only.

  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
    <header>What should I do if my child has symptoms of COVID-19?</header>
      <p>
        Seek medical attention. If advised by the doctor, then get your child tested for COVID-19. If advised by a doctor isolate/stay home.
      </p>
      <p>
        Record temperature and oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter if available at home, every 6 hours. Measure their temperature frequently. If it is more than 100-degree F, then you can do tepid sponging with tap water and give them syrup or tablet paracetamol. If fever is >100°F, give paracetamol 10–15 mg/kg/dose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Continue to follow good hand and respiratory hygiene practices like regular handwashing with soap so that your child is protected against other viruses and bacteria causing diseases.
      </p>
      <p>
        Continue to follow personal protective measures for yourself and your child. Your child should wear a surgical mask anytime they are around people. Change the mask after eight hours of continuous wear. Caregivers interacting with the child should wear gloves and a mask.

  <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">
    <header>What should we do if my child has been in contact with someone who has tested positive?</header>
      <p>
        To start with, do not panic. Your family member with COVID-19 needs to isolate immediately, in a separate room from the rest of the family (if possible),and seek medical advice.

        No-one should enter the room where your family member is isolating (adults or children).
      </p>
      <p>
        While your family member is isolating, interact with them from outside the room via a doorway, and always wear a mask.
        Feed your child home-cooked food and keep them well hydrated. Give plenty of liquids and give a soft and light diet. One may give vitamin C, zinc to boost overall health and immunity.
        Other nutritional supplements like syrup multivitamin, Vitamin C, vitamin D, calcium can be given as per their doctor’s advice.

    <header>If any of these signs are present, seek urgent medical advice at your nearest hospital.</header>
      <p>If any of these following signs are present, seek medical advice from doctor</p>
      <p>
        Indrawing of chest,

        Looks drowsy or lethargic,
        Abnormal body movement,
        Severe diarrhea, vomiting or abdominal pain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stay safe by taking some simple precautions, such as physical distancing, wearing a mask, especially when distancing cannot be maintained, keeping rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds and close contact, regularly cleaning your hands, and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue. Check local advice where you live and work. Do it all!.
      </p>

      <p>
        The time from exposure to COVID-19 to the moment when symptoms begin is, on average, 5-6 days and can range from 1-14 days. This is why people who have been exposed to the virus are advised to remain at home and stay away from others, for 14 days, in order to prevent the spread of the virus, especially where testing is not easily available.
      </p>

      <p>
        Optimal supportive care includes oxygen for severely ill patients and those who are at risk for severe disease and more advanced respiratory support such as ventilation for patients who are critically ill.

        Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that can help reduce the length of time on a ventilator and save lives of patients with severe and critical illness.

  <section class="main-section" id="if...else_statement">
    <header>What precautions should I take for my family if we travel?</header>
    <p>
      Anyone planning a trip overseas should always check the travel advisory for their destination country for any restrictions on entry, quarantine requirements on entry, or other relevant travel advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to taking standard travel precautions, and in order to avoid being quarantined or denied re-entry into your home country, you are also advised to check the latest COVID-19 update on the International Air Transport Association website, which includes a list of countries and restriction measures.
    </p>
    <p>
      While traveling, all parents should follow standard hygiene measures for themselves and their children: Wash hands frequently or use an alcohol-based sanitizer with at least 60 per cent alcohol, practice good respiratory hygiene (cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze and immediately dispose of the used tissue) and avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
    </p>
      <p>
       In addition, it is recommended that parents always carry a hand sanitizer, pack of disposable tissues, and disinfecting wipes.

        Additional recommendations include: Clean your seat, armrest, touchscreen, etc. with a disinfecting wipe once inside an aircraft or other vehicle. Also use a disinfecting wipe to clean key surfaces, doorknobs, remote controls, etc at the hotel or other accommodation where you and your children are staying.
      </p>
      <p>
      Results from the WHO’s Solidarity Trial indicated that remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon regimens appear to have little or no effect on 28-day mortality or the in-hospital course of COVID-19 among hospitalized patients.

      Hydroxychloroquine has not been shown to offer any benefit for treatment of COVID-19. Read our hydroxychloroquine Q&A for more information.

      WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop treatments for COVID-19 and will continue to provide new information as it becomes available.

    <header>Can pregnant women pass coronavirus to unborn children?</header>
    <p>
      At this time, there is not enough evidence to determine whether the virus is transmitted from a mother to her baby during pregnancy, or the potential impact this may have on the baby. This is currently being investigated. Pregnant women should continue to follow appropriate precautions to protect themselves from exposure to the virus, and seek medical care early, if experiencing symptoms, such as fever, cough or difficulty breathing.
    </p>
      <p>
        There is much that is still unknown about the risks of COVID-19 to pregnant women and the baby. Here are some of the known risks that women can avoid during their pregnancy-

        Mother to child transmission of COVID-19 is not likely during pregnancy. But after birth, the newborn can be infected after being in close contact with an infected person, including the mother and other caregivers.

        The number of babies that have been tested positive is less, according to published reports. But, it’s unknown if the babies contracted the virus before, during, or after birth.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s vital that you take care of yourself and your baby, during and after pregnancy, here are some of the prenatal and post-natal precautions you can take during the COVID-19 pandemic:

        Inquire your healthcare provider about the necessary steps that are being taken to separate healthy patients from the ones who are sick.
      </p>

      <p>There is something encouraging for pregnant women who may be exposed to the SARS -COV 2virus, that according to a new observational study on COVID 19 in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy, the virus does not appear to travel across the placenta from mother to cause infection of the fetus(published in ARCHIVES OF PATHOLOGY AND LABORATORY MEDICINE, CHINA.)</p>
      <p>
        The love of a mother to her child is unconditional so there are some important ways you can stay healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Avoid people who are sick or who have been exposed to the virus.</li>
        <li>Stay home whenever you can or stay six feet away from people when you’re outdoors.</li>
        <li>Wash your hands with a sanitizing soap, after exposure to any foreign objects.</li>
        <li>After coming into contact with surfaces outside your home or items that are delivered to your home.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Nutrition is a key factor for both pregnant women & babies considering the diet of a pregnant woman. Fruits& vegetables, General food items, Milk and Milk products, Rich in protein, Dry fruits, Immune boosters I believe there are 5 essential items that should be on their plate.

    <header>Is it safe for a mother to breastfeed if she is infected with coronavirus?</header>
      <p>
      All mothers in affected and at-risk areas who have symptoms of fever, cough or difficulty breathing, should seek medical care early, and follow instructions from a health care provider.
      </p>
      <p>
        Considering the benefits of breastfeeding and the insignificant role of breastmilk in the transmission of other respiratory viruses, the mother can continue breastfeeding, while applying all the necessary precautions.
      </p>
      <p>
        For symptomatic mothers well enough to breastfeed, this includes wearing a mask when near a child (including during feeding), washing hands before and after contact with the child (including feeding), and cleaning/disinfecting contaminated surfaces – as should be done in all cases where anyone with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 interacts with others, including children.
      </p>
      <p>
        The function square takes one argument, called number. The function
        consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the
        function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement
        specifies the value returned by the function.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a mother is too ill, she should be encouraged to express milk and give it to the child via a clean cup and/or spoon – all while following the same infection prevention methods.
